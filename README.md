# url-shortner-api

`AWS Hosted Project`

This project contains the necessary infrastructure as code and lambda code to host a URL shortener API. Convert any long URL's to a short one. Easily connect this API to your front end application.

**AWS Services Used**:

* AWS Lambda: For the backend API.
* AWS DynamoDB: For storing link references.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To deploy the application you must have [terraform cli](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) and [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed.

You must have a `aws profile` configured for terraform to use it and deploy it into your AWS account:

```
aws configure --profile <YOUR_PROFILE_NAME>
```

To begin, open the `provider.tf` file and under the aws provider change the profile used. Put your own profile name in `<YOUR_AWS_CONFIGURE_PROFILE>`. Then change the `<YOUR_AWS_REGION>` to `us-east-1`.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  profile = "profile_name"
}
```

Next, go to `vars.tf` and change in `locals` the following values: `domain_name` and `domain_protocol`.

# üöÄ Deployment
Execute the following commands to deploy the infrastructure and lambdas:

```sh
npm install --prefix ./functions/get-short-url
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Once deployed, you should see in the outputs the URL's pointing to your lambdas.

# üîó API Usage

The API contains 3 different lambdas. Below we explain how to use each:

* `get_short_url`: Generates the `shortValue` from a long url and stores it in a DynamoDB table.
* `get_original_url`: Fetches the original URL by passing a `shortValue` generated by the first API call.
* `get_url_stats`: Fetches details about a URL without increasing the `viewsCount` property.

## Get Short URL
